<h2 id="overview">1. Overview</h2>

<p>
This project will give you experience writing multi-threaded
programs using monitors.  In this project, you will write a simple
concurrent program that schedules disk requests.  This concurrent program
will use a thread library that we provide.

<p>
<strong><font color="#FF0000">This project is to be done
individually.</font></strong>

<h2>2. Thread library interface</h2>

<p>
This section describes the interface that the thread library and
infrastructure provide to applications.  You will write a multi-threaded
program that uses this interface.  The interface consists of four classes:
<tt>cpu</tt>, <tt>thread</tt>, <tt>mutex</tt>, and <tt>cv</tt>, which are
declared in <a href=cpu.h><tt>cpu.h</tt></a>,
<a href=thread.h><tt>thread.h</tt></a>,
<a href=mutex.h><tt>mutex.h</tt></a>, and <a href=cv.h><tt>cv.h</tt></a>
(do not modify these files).  For convenience,
<a href=thread.h><tt>thread.h</tt></a> includes the other header files.

<p>
To use the thread library, programs <tt>#include
<a href=thread.h>thread.h</a></tt> and link with
<a href=libcpu.a><tt>libcpu.a</tt></a> and
<a href=thread.o><tt>thread.o</tt></a>.

<h3>2.1. <tt>cpu</tt> class</h3>

<p>
The <tt>cpu</tt> class is declared in <a href=cpu.h><tt>cpu.h</tt></a> and
is used mainly by the thread library.  The only part used by applications
is the <tt>cpu::boot</tt> function:

<pre>
    static void boot(thread_startfunc_t func, void *arg, unsigned int deterministic);
</pre>

<p>
<tt>cpu::boot</tt> starts the thread library and creates the initial
thread, which is initialized to call the function pointed to by
<tt>func</tt> with the single argument <tt>arg</tt>.  A user program should
call <tt>cpu::boot</tt> exactly once (before calling any other thread functions).
On success, <tt>cpu::boot</tt> does not return.

<p>
<tt>deterministic</tt> specifies if the thread library should be deterministic
or not.  Setting <tt>deterministic</tt> to zero makes the scheduling of threads
non-deterministic, i.e., different runs may generate different results.
Setting <tt>deterministic</tt> to a non-zero value forces the scheduling of
threads to be deterministic, i.e., a program will generate the same
results if it is run with the same value for <tt>deterministic</tt> (different
non-zero values for <tt>deterministic</tt> will lead to different results).

<p>
Note that <tt>cpu::boot</tt> is a <tt>static</tt> member function and is
invoked on the <tt>cpu</tt> class (not on an instance of the <tt>cpu</tt>
class).

<h3>2.2. <tt>thread</tt> class</h3

<p>
The <tt>thread</tt> class is declared in
<a href=thread.h><tt>thread.h</tt></a>.  All functions throw
the <tt>std::runtime_error</tt> exception on an error.

<p>
The constructor is used to create a new thread.  When the newly created
thread starts, it will call the function pointed to by <tt>func</tt> and
pass it the single argument <tt>arg</tt>.

<pre>
    thread(thread_startfunc_t func, void *arg);
</pre>

<p>
<tt>join</tt> causes the current thread to block until the specified thread
has exited.  If the specified thread has already exited, <tt>join</tt>
returns immediately.

<pre>
    void join();
</pre>

<h3>2.3. <tt>mutex</tt> class</h3

<p>
The <tt>mutex</tt> class is declared in
<a href=mutex.h><tt>mutex.h</tt></a>.  All functions throw an
<tt>std::runtime_error</tt> exception on an error.

<p>
The constructor is used to create a new mutex.

<pre>
    mutex();
</pre>

<p>
<tt>lock</tt> atomically waits for the mutex to be free and
acquires it for the current thread.

<pre>
    void lock();
</pre>

<p>
<tt>unlock</tt> releases the mutex.

<pre>
    void unlock();
</pre>

<h3>2.4. <tt>cv</tt> class</h3

<p>
The <tt>cv</tt> class is declared in <a href=cv.h><tt>cv.h</tt></a>.  All
functions throw an <tt>std::runtime_error</tt> exception on an error.

<p>
The constructor is used to create a new condition variable.

<pre>
    cv();
</pre>

<p>
<tt>wait</tt> atomically releases mutex <tt>m</tt> and waits on the
condition queue.  When the thread is signalled, <tt>wait</tt> will
re-acquire the mutex before returning.

<pre>
    void wait(mutex& m);
</pre>

<p>
<tt>signal</tt> signals one of the threads on the condition queue.

<pre>
    void signal();
</pre>

<p>
<tt>broadcast</tt> signals all of the threads on the condition queue.

<pre>
    void broadcast();
</pre>

<h3 id="example">2.5. Example program</h3>

<p>
Here is a short program that uses threads.

<hr>
<pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include "thread.h"

using namespace std;

mutex mutex1;
cv cv1;

int child_done = 0;		// global variable; shared between the two threads.

void child(void *a)
{
    char *message = (char *) a;
    mutex1.lock();
    cout << "child run with message " << message << ", setting child_done = 1\n";
    child_done = 1;
    cv1.signal();
    mutex1.unlock();
}

void parent(void *a)
{
    intptr_t arg = (intptr_t) a;
    cout << "parent called with arg " << arg << endl;
    thread t1 ((thread_startfunc_t) child, (void *) "test message");
    mutex1.lock();
    while (!child_done) {
        cout << "parent waiting for child to run\n";
        cv1.wait(mutex1);
    }
    cout << "parent finishing" << endl;
    mutex1.unlock();
}

int main()
{
    cpu::boot((thread_startfunc_t) parent, (void *) 100, 0);
}
</pre>

<hr>

<p>
Here are the <strong>two</strong> possible outputs the program can generate.

<hr>

<pre>
parent called with arg 100
parent waiting for child to run
child run with message test message, setting child_done = 1
parent finishing
No runnable threads.  Exiting.
<hr>
parent called with arg 100
child run with message test message, setting child_done = 1
parent finishing
No runnable threads.  Exiting.
</pre>

<h2 id="diskscheduler">3. Disk scheduler</h2>

<p>
Your task for this project is to write a concurrent program that
issues and services disk requests.

<p>
The disk scheduler in an operating system receives and schedules requests
for disk I/Os.  Threads issue disk requests by queueing them at the disk
scheduler.  The disk scheduler queue can contain at most a specified number
of requests (<tt>max_disk_queue</tt>); threads must wait if the queue is full.

<p>
Your program should start by creating a specified number of requester threads
to issue disk requests and one thread to service disk requests.  Each
requester thread should issue a series of requests for disk tracks (specified
in its input file).  Each request is <strong>synchronous</strong>;
a requester thread must wait until the servicing thread finishes handling
that requester's last request before that requester issues its next
request.  A requester thread finishes after all the requests in its input
file have been serviced.

<p>
Requests in the disk queue are <strong>not</strong> necessarily serviced in
FIFO order.  Instead, the service thread handles disk requests in SSTF
order (shortest seek time first).  That is, the next request it services is
the request that is closest to its current track.  The disk is initialized
with its current track as 0.

<p>
Keep the disk queue as full as possible; your service thread should only
handle a request when the disk queue has the largest possible number of
requests.  This gives the service thread the largest number of requests to
choose from, which in turn helps minimize average seek distance.  Note that
the value of "the largest possible number of requests" varies depending on
how many request threads are still active.  When at least
<tt>max_disk_queue</tt> requester threads are alive, the largest possible
number of requests in the queue is equal to <tt>max_disk_queue</tt>.  When
fewer than <tt>max_disk_queue</tt> requester threads are alive, the largest
number of requests in the queue is equal to the number of living requester
threads.  A requester is considered to be active from the time the program
starts until all its requests have been serviced.

<h3 id="input">3.1. Input</h3>

<p>
Your program will be called with several command-line arguments.  The first
argument specifies the maximum number of requests that the disk queue can
hold.  The rest of the arguments specify a list of input files (one input file
per requester).  I.e., the input file for requester r is argv[r+2], where
0 <= r < (number of requesters).  The number of threads making disk requests
should be deduced from the number of input files specified.

<p>
The input file for each requester contains that requester's series of requests.
Each line of the input file specifies the track number of the request (0 to
999).  You may assume that input files are formatted correctly.  Open each
input file read-only (<strong>use <tt>ifstream</tt> rather than
<tt>fstream</tt></strong>).

<h3 id="output">3.2. Output</h3>

<p>
After issuing a request, a requester thread should execute the following
code (note the space characters in the strings):
<pre>
<tt>cout << "requester " << requester << " track " << track << endl;</tt>
</pre>

<p>
A request is available to be serviced when the requester thread prints this
line.

<p>
After servicing a request, the service thread should execute the following
code (note the space characters in the strings):
<pre>
cout << "service requester " << requester << " track " << track << endl;
</pre>

<p>
A request is considered to be off the queue when the service thread
prints this line.

<p>
Your program should not generate any other output.

<p>
The console is shared between the different threads, so your
program's calls to <tt>cout</tt> must be protected by a monitor lock to
prevent intermingling output from multiple threads.

<h3 id="exampleio">3.3. Example input/output</h3>

<p>
Here is an example set of input files (disk.in0 - disk.in4).

<table border=1>
<thead>
    <tr>
        <th><a href=disk.in0>disk.in0</a></th>
        <th><a href=disk.in1>disk.in1</a></th>
        <th><a href=disk.in2>disk.in2</a></th>
        <th><a href=disk.in3>disk.in3</a></th>
        <th><a href=disk.in4>disk.in4</a></th>
    </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
    <tr>
	<td>785<br>53</td> <td>350<br>914</td> <td>827<br>567</td> <td>302<br>230</td> <td>631<br>11</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
Here is one of many possible correct outputs from running the disk
scheduler with the following command (the final line of the output is
produced by the thread library, not the disk scheduler):

<pre>
disk 3 disk.in0 disk.in1 disk.in2 disk.in3 disk.in4
<hr>
requester 2 track 827
requester 1 track 350
requester 3 track 302
service requester 3 track 302
requester 4 track 631
service requester 1 track 350
requester 0 track 785
service requester 4 track 631
requester 3 track 230
service requester 0 track 785
requester 1 track 914
service requester 2 track 827
requester 4 track 11
service requester 1 track 914
requester 0 track 53
service requester 3 track 230
requester 2 track 567
service requester 0 track 53
service requester 4 track 11
service requester 2 track 567
No runnable threads.  Exiting.

</pre>

<h2 id="logistics">4. Project logistics</h2>

<p>
Write your disk scheduler in C++ on Linux.  Use <tt>g++ 4.8.2</tt> to compile
your programs.  To use <tt>g++ 4.8.2</tt> on CAEN
computers, put the following command in your startup file (e.g.,
<tt>~/.profile</tt>):

<pre>
module load gcc
module load gdb/7.5.1
</pre>

<!--
<p>
You should also set the <tt>LD_BIND_NOW</tt> environment variable to 1.
This works around an apparent incompatibility between the thread library
and the Linux dynamic linker.  Add the following line to your
<tt>~/.profile</tt>:

<pre>
export LD_BIND_NOW=1
</pre>
-->

<p>
You may use any functions included in the standard C++ library (including
the STL), except for C++11 threads.  You should not use any libraries other
than the standard C++ library (e.g., pthreads).  To compile your disk
scheduler (e.g., <tt>disk.cc</tt>), run:

<pre>
g++ thread.o disk.cc libcpu.a -ldl -pthread -std=c++11
</pre>

<p>
You may add options <tt>-g</tt> and <tt>-Wall</tt> for debugging and
<tt>-o</tt> to name the executable.

<p>
Your disk scheduler code may be in multiple files.
Each file name must end with <tt>.cc</tt>, <tt>.cpp</tt>, or <tt>.h</tt>
and must not start with <tt>test</tt>.

<p>
We have created a private <a href="https://github.com/eecs482">github</a>
repository for each student
(<tt>eecs482/&ltuniqname&gt.1</tt>)
Initialize
your local repository by cloning the (empty) repositories from github, e.g.,

<pre>
git clone git@github.com:eecs482/uniqname.1
</pre>

<h2 id="grading">5. Grading, auto-grading, and formatting</h2>

<p>
To help you validate your programs, your submissions will be graded
automatically, and the results will be provided to you.  You may then
continue to work on the project and re-submit.  The results from the
auto-grader will not be very illuminating; they won't tell you where your
problem is or give you the test inputs.  The main purpose of the
auto-grader is to help you know to keep working on your project (rather
than thinking it's perfect and ending up with a 0).  The best way to debug
your program is to generate your own test inputs, understand the
constraints on correct answers for these inputs, and determine if your
program's output obeys these constraints.  This is also one of the best
ways to learn the concepts in the project.

<p>
You may submit your program as many times as you like.  However, only the
feedback from the first submission of each day will be provided to you.
Later submissions on that day will be graded and cataloged, but the results
will not be provided to you.  See the <a href=../faq.html#limit>FAQ</a> for
why we use this policy.

<p>
In addition to this one-per-day policy, you will be given 3 bonus submissions
that also provide feedback.  These will be used automatically--any submission
you make after the first one of that day will use one of your bonus
submissions.  After your 3 bonus submissions are used up, the system will
continue to provide 1 feedback per day.

<p>
Because you are writing concurrent programs, the auto-grader may return
non-deterministic results.  In particular, test cases 5-8 are
non-deterministic.

<p>
Because your programs will be auto-graded, you must be careful to follow the
exact rules in the project description.  In particular:

<li>Your program should print only the two items specified in
<a href="#output">Section 3.2</a>.

<li>Your program should expect several command-line
arguments, with the first being <tt>max_disk_queue</tt> and the others
specifying the list of input files for the requester threads.

<li>Do not modify or rename the header files provided in this handout.

<h2 id="submission">6. Turning in the project</h2>

<p>
<a href=../submit.php?1>Submit</a> the following file for your disk scheduler:

<ul>
<li>C++ files for your disk scheduler.  File names should end in
<tt>.cc</tt>, <tt>.cpp</tt>, or <tt>.h</tt> and must not start with <tt>test</tt>.
Do not submit the files provided in this handout.
</ul>

</ul>

<p>
The official time of submission for your project will be the time of
your last submission.  Submissions after the due date will
automatically use up your late days; if you have no late days left,
late submissions will not be counted.
